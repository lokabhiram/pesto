# Overview

This document outlines the proposed data engineering solution for AdvertiseX, addressing the challenges of ingesting, processing, storing, and analyzing large volumes of advertising data from various sources. The solution utilizes a combination of open-source technologies to build a scalable and efficient data pipeline.

## Technology Stack

### Data Ingestion:
- Apache Kafka
- Kafka Connect
- Fluentd
- Apache Airflow

### Data Processing:
- Apache Spark

### Data Storage:
- Apache Hadoop HDFS
- Apache Hive
- Apache Kylin (optional)

### Data Monitoring:
- Apache Spark Streaming
- Prometheus
- Grafana

## Data Ingestion
### Ad Impressions (JSON):
- Fluentd agents collect JSON logs from web servers and send them to a dedicated Kafka topic.
- Kafka Connect with a JSON connector ingests data from the Kafka topic into HDFS.

### Clicks and Conversions (CSV):
- Airflow schedules a Spark job to read CSV files from the tracking system.
- The Spark job performs data cleaning, transformation, and validation before storing the processed data in HDFS.

### Bid Requests (Avro):
- A custom application reads Avro data from the RTB platform and publishes it to a Kafka topic.
- Kafka Connect with an Avro connector ingests data from the Kafka topic into HDFS.

## Data Processing
### Data Transformation and Enrichment:
- An Airflow-scheduled Spark job reads raw data from HDFS.
- The job performs:
  - Parsing and validation of JSON and Avro data.
  - Cleaning and standardization of CSV data.
  - Joining ad impression data with click and conversion data using user ID and timestamps.
  - Enrichment with additional data sources (e.g., user demographics).
- The processed data is stored in a Hive table partitioned by date and campaign ID and bucketed by user ID.

## Data Storage
### Data Lake (HDFS):
- Stores raw and processed data for long-term retention and archival.

### Data Warehouse (Hive):
- Enables ad-hoc querying and analysis of processed data using SQL-like syntax.

### OLAP Cube (Kylin - optional):
- Pre-aggregates key metrics for faster analytical queries on campaign performance.

## Error Handling and Monitoring
- Spark Streaming: Continuously monitors Kafka topics for data anomalies and inconsistencies.
- Metrics and Alerts: Data volume, processing time, and error rates are tracked in Prometheus and visualized in Grafana, with alerts for potential issues.
- Error Logging: Detailed error logs are captured for troubleshooting. Airflow handles retries and error recovery.

## Additional Considerations
- Security: Sensitive user data is protected with access control and encryption mechanisms.
- Scalability: The solution utilizes distributed technologies like Kafka, Spark, and HDFS to handle growing data volumes.
- Cost Optimization: Cost-effective cloud storage and resource management strategies are employed.

## Technology Justification
- Kafka: Provides high throughput, low latency, and fault tolerance for real-time data streaming.
- Spark: Offers distributed processing capabilities for efficient data transformation and analysis.
- HDFS: Provides scalable and reliable storage for large datasets.
- Hive: Enables SQL-like querying for data analysis and exploration.
- Kylin (optional): Accelerates analytical queries on large datasets.

## Deployment and Operations
- The data pipeline can be deployed on a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure for scalability and flexibility.
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform can automate infrastructure provisioning.
- Containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes can simplify deployment and management.

## Benefits
- Scalability and Efficiency: Handles large data volumes with efficient processing and storage.
- Real-time Insights: Enables real-time monitoring and analysis of campaign performance.
- Improved Decision Making: Provides valuable insights for optimizing ad campaigns and maximizing ROI.
- Flexibility and Modularity: Allows for easy integration of new data sources and processing steps.

## Next Steps
- Implement and test the data pipeline with sample data.
- Integrate with existing data sources and systems at AdvertiseX.
- Develop dashboards and reports for campaign performance analysis.
- Continuously monitor and optimize the pipeline for performance and cost-effectiveness.

## Conclusion
This data engineering solution provides AdvertiseX with a robust and scalable platform to effectively manage and analyze advertising data, empowering them to make data-driven decisions and optimize campaign performance.
